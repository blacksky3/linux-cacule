# CPU Scheduler

## CacULE CPU Scheduler

![cacule_sched](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68618182/103179297-92ac0100-4858-11eb-83aa-8992f33d67f8.png)

CacULE is a newer version of Cachy. The CacULE CPU scheduler is based on interactivity score mechanism.
The interactivity score is inspired by the ULE scheduler (FreeBSD scheduler).

About CacULE Scheduler

- Each CPU has its own runqueue.
- NORMAL runqueue is a linked list of sched_entities (instead of RB-Tree).
- RT and other runqueues are just the same as the CFS's.
- Wake up tasks preempt currently running tasks if its interactivity score value is higher.

### RDB load balancer

An experimental load balancer for CacULE. It is a lightweight load balancer which is a replacement of CFS load balancer.
It migrates tasks based on their interactivity scores.

# Update GRUB

    sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
